"""
This module provides a collection of methods that automate the process of getting the capabilities needed to
instanciate an appium webdriver. We execute the adb commands provided by the Android SDK. We turn it into a json or
dict and write it in files o get it from files.
The key methods here are get_basic_capabilities_for_driver(), to_file_capabilities(capability_profile: str) and 
get_capabilities_from_file(capability_profile: str):
In order for all these to work you need to connect your phone or get your emulator up and running correctly and open
your app and keep the screen unlocked:
- get_basic_capabilities_for_driver() -> With this method we use different adb commands to return the capabilities
needed to instantiate a webdriver object and get our appium tests running
to_file_capabilities(capability_profile: str) -> This method calls to get_basic_capabilities_for_driver() and saves
the capabilities to a json file with name "capability_profile" in folder profiles
- get_capabilities_from_file(capability_profile: str): This method reads the json file named "capability_profile"
 in folder profiles with the capabilities needed for our appium tests
